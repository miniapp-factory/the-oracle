An abstract representation of a person's aura, depicted as swirling colors and subtle light patterns that emanate from a stylized silhouette of a human figure. The background is a deep gradient of midnight blue and indigo, with faint stars or sparkles to suggest depth and mystery. The aura itself should be vibrant, with hues of teal, magenta, gold, and soft white, flowing outward in concentric waves, giving the impression of energy and personality. The overall composition is balanced, with the silhouette centered and the aura radiating symmetrically, creating a sense of harmony and uniqueness.
